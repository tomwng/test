It was 2001, and Bill Clinton was upbeat.

“There’s no question China has been trying to crack down on the Internet,” he said. “Good luck. That’s sort of like trying to nail Jello to the wall.”

The internet would inevitably push China toward democracy, he said. How could any country control something so amorphous and still be technologically vibrant? Something would surely have to give.

He was wrong. The whole West was wrong.

Today, China has the world’s only internet companies that can match America’s in ambition and reach.

It is years ahead of the United States in replacing paper money with smartphone payments, turning tech giants into vital gatekeepers of the consumer economy.

And it is host to a supernova of creative expression — on short videos, podcasts, blogs and streaming TV — that ought to dispel any notions of Chinese culture as drearily conformist.

All of this on an internet walled off from Facebook and Google, policed by hundreds of thousands of Communist Party censors and fueled by billions of dollars in state investment. It has 700 million users, twice the population of the United States.

Chinese tech giants do have regular run-ins with the government. But it would be wrong to mistake authoritarianism for hostility toward technology. In many ways, Chinese tech firms are less fettered than American ones. Witness the backlash against Big Data in the United States, the calls to regulate giants like Facebook, the anxiety about digital addiction. None of those are big problems for Chinese companies.

Many Chinese internet powerhouses started out by copying Silicon Valley.

But the flow of inspiration now runs both ways. American social media executives look to Tencent and Toutiao for the latest tricks for keeping users glued to their phones. (The video app Douyin, for instance, fills your screen entirely, blocking out the little clock at the top. That conveniently prevents you from seeing how many hours you’ve wasted flipping through videos.)

In China, there is pretty much only one rule, and it is simple: Don’t undermine the state.

So titans like Weibo and Baidu heed censorship orders. Unwanted beliefs and ideologies are kept out.

Beyond that, everything is fair game. Start-ups can achieve mammoth scale with astonishing speed; they can also crash brutally.

Thanks to weak intellectual property protections, they can rip one another off with abandon — not great for rewarding innovation, but OK for consumers, who get lots of choices.

In another advantage, old-school industries like media, finance and health care have been dominated by lumbering state-run giants. That has allowed internet champions like Alibaba and Tencent to sew themselves into these businesses with ease. The two companies have been trying to disrupt healthcare in China since well before Amazon began experimenting with its employees’ coverage.

This level of clout hasn’t gone unnoticed by China’s leaders. Never in the Communist era have private entities wielded such influence over people’s lives. More and more, tech firms need to make themselves useful to Beijing, or risk getting their wings clipped.

The Communist Party is demanding seats on companies’ boards. It’s forcing them to start spying on people and providing that information to the government.

Nearly everyone in China uses Tencent’s WeChat messaging app, which is why the social network is a great way for the authorities to police what people say and do. SenseTime, whose facial recognition technology powers those fun filters in video apps, also sells software to law enforcement.

A restrictive state and a vibrant tech scene go together just fine — as long as they can continue to share.
